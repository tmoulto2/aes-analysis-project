# AES Analysis & Decryption Workflow

## Overview
This project was completed as part of an academic ethical hacking course.  
The goal was to build a structured, milestone-based process to identify an AES encryption key,
decrypt a protected message, and interpret the recovered plaintext.

## Project Structure
The work is divided into four milestones, each with a specific objective and measurable output.

- **Milestone 1:** Problem analysis and workflow planning
- **Milestone 2:** AES key identification logic
- **Milestone 3:** Decryption and output validation
- **Milestone 4:** Final workflow integration and interpretation

## Tools & Concepts
- Python
- AES cryptography fundamentals
- Verification and validation techniques
- Structured security analysis

## Scope & Ethics
This project was conducted in a controlled academic environment.
The code is provided for educational purposes only and demonstrates
cryptography concepts and secure analytical workflows.

## What This Demonstrates
- Breaking complex security problems into manageable steps
- Applying cryptographic concepts responsibly
- Clear documentation and verification mindset
